<h3>My Story: How I Became a Dawg</h3>
<p>My name is Jeri Sasser and I am a junior at the <span class="c1">University of Georgia.</span> I am currently studying Psychology with a minor in Human Development and Family Science.</p>
<p>Although Georgia is what feels most like home to me, I was born in Austin, Texas to two amazing parents. I was raised there on a ranch with one brother, one sister, and an abundance of cows, horses, chickens, and even donkeys! Whenever I was 6, I moved to Edmond, Oklahoma where I spent the next seven years of my life. Then, finally, when I was 12, I moved to Suwanee, Georgia where I would remain until my graduation from Lambert High School.</p>
<p>Upon graduating high school, I decided to attend the University of Oklahoma for my college experience. But during my Spring Break that year, I came back to Georgia to visit all of my friends from high school here in Athens. I had never really visited Athens much before or given any thought into the idea of going to UGA, so I was blown away to find how much I loved the town, community, and of course, the school!</p>
<p>After my Spring Break, I went back to Oklahoma and completed my freshman year. But sure enough, that following summer I made the decision to transfer to the University of Georgia. I have been in Athens for over a year now and I am about to complete my second semester here at UGA. I have loved every second of it, and I could not be happier to be here.</p>

<h3>Plans Upon Graduation</h3>
<p>After graduation, I plan to attend graduate school and obtain a <abbr title="Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs">CACREP</abbr> accredited degree to become a counselor. I will most likely either obtain a master's degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, or study longer to earn my PhD (or PsyD) in Clinical Psychology.</p>
<p> Mental health, particularly within adolescence, is something that I have always been very passionate about. My primary goal is to become a therapist and help people to the best of my ability, but I have also considered venturing more into the research field so that I may help seek out the best types of preventative treatment for specific disorders such as depression and anxiety.</P>
<p>In addition to pursuing a career in mental health, I also hope to somehow incorporate aviation into my life. The art of flying is something that has always been very important to me and my family. In fact, we started a foundation rooted in leadership and flight: <a href="http://www.sasserfoundation.org/">The Hank Sasser Foundation</a>&#8482;
<p>I hope to follow in my brother and father's footsteps and obtain my private pilot's license within the next 5 years. Although it may seem like an odd fit, I believe that flying and mental health have the potential to compliment each other quite well. It is a dream of mine to combine the two and find a way to use my flying ability to better impact the lives of others.</p>
<p> My philosophy in life is best summed up by this quote from my brother:</p> 
<blockquote><p style="color:red;"><b>"I'm in the business of changing lives"</b></P></blockquote>
